{-
We say that character pair (c1,c2) appears in string s with gap g,
if c1 is before c2 and there are exactly g characters between c1 and c2 in s.
Write a function that, given a pair (c1,c2) a gap g, and a string s,
returns an Int telling how many times (c1,c2) appear in s with gap g.

E.g. ('a','b') with gap 1 appears 2 times in â€œaaabbb".

Use recursion.
